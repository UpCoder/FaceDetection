- directly using vgg16, it is using same params that include the param of conv and  the param of full connection
    - how to run? 
        - test_image_path is the detected image path
        - flod_dir is the training dataset. Due to the limit of memeory, we just extract one floder images's boudning box
        - point two value, then run trained_vgg16.npy
